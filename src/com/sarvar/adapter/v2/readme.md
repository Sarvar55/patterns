# Adapter Design Pattern in Java

The Adapter desing pattern is a Powerful and essential tool for software developers. Itl helps to create floexible and maintainable code byb allowing objects with incompatible interfaces to work together (seamlessly)(sorunsuzca). In this (comprehensive)(kapsamlı) guide, we will explore the Adapter Design Pattern in depth covering its key concepts, nenefits, and real-world examples. We aill also look at its implementations and how it can be used to solve common software design problems.

## What is Adapter Design Pattern

Adapter design pattern is one of Structural design pattern and it is used so that two (unrelated)(ilgisiz,ilgisi olmayan) interfaces can work together. Is is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
The pattern involves creating an adapter class that bridges the (gap)(açıklık,boşluk) between the interfaces, allowing them to communicate effectively.

One real-world example of the Adapter Design Pattern is a mobile charger. Mobile chargers (act)(eylem,davranmak) as adapters between the power socket and the mobile device, converting the voltage to a (suitable)(uygun) level for charging the device.
In software development, the Adapter Design Pattern follows the same concept by introducing an additional adapter class between an existing interface and a class that needs to work with it.

### The Components of the Adapter Design Pattern -:

- Target: This represents the interface or class that the client code expects to work with. It (defines)(tanımlar) the operations that the client can use.

- Adaptee: This refers to the existing class or interface that (needs to be adapted.)(uyarlanması gerekmektedir.). It has a differen interface that is incompatible with the client's expectations.

- Adapter: This is the class that bridges the gap between the Target and Adaptee. It implements the Target interface and internally uses an instance of the Adaptee to perform the desired operations. The Adapter class acts as a wrapper or translator, addapting the Adaptee's interface to match the Target interface.
